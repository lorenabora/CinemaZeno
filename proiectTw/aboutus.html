                <h2>VintageHall</h2>
                <p> Our VintageHall is designed to copy the atmosphere of an old cinematography. With a lot of red seats, cozy, but small, the black walls and the dirty-white screen, the old black and white movies are yet again brought back to life for the lovers of the retro movies. We insist in trying this hall for at least once in a lifetime, to experience a true moment frozen in time. </p>

                <p> On the other hand, AeroHall makes a dream come true for the futuristic guests or the ones who want to feel the SF or action movies. With boxes incorporated in the walls, seats that move with each attack or brutal action in the film, you ARE part of it, entirely. Give it a shot!</p>

                <h2>Wonder Room</h2>
                <p>All the kids these days enjoy a great movie on a bigger screen than the one from home, but have you ever seen a room specialy designed for them? The seats are comfty and a little bit taller for them to see the screen better; the boxes are diligently set for the best experience, but protecting the hearing of the little ones. The parents can stay in the room with them or let them on the hands of our staff, so they can enjoy a more suitable movie in another of our rooms. The animations are from classics to modern productions, so don't worry, they won't miss a single story! </p>
