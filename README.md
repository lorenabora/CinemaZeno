## Why built this?
This is the face of an fictional site that I built using only frontend languages for a better understanding on how to create a site from the scratch. I wanted to use my concepts of design and coding skills in actually a real product because, to be honest, most websites don't have the most appealing appearance.

## Features
- multi-page site, navigating through a menu
- implementing standard header/footer for a stronger easy-to-know on which page the user is and how to move back to home page
- login form (NOT at all secure, it was a practice exercise on how to create it, but the data stored in each session is way too vulnerable)
- animation type carousel (from `https://freefrontend.com/css-carousels/` with additional changes)
- on-click greatings in several foreign languages (practise exercise using a json file and random function)

## Languages used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to unlock the dynamic js exercises
You need to change the site on localhost, for that you need to:
1. Because the project is static, run in bash/cmd the following command: `python -m http.server 8000`. This will make it easier to connect as localhost to the site.
2. Then open on your browser the site, making sure that the first part of the URL looks like this: `http://localhost:8000/...`. With a refresh, you should be ready to go and explore the intgerastives applications that I created using js.

## Lessons learnt
1. Center a div? A challenge I actually laught it out before I actually spent a full day on the menu
2. Understanding how each language I used creates part of the site
3. Styling using layers in CSS and animations/transitions
4. Working with exceptions, random functions and interactive elements with JavaScript

## Future Plans
- Maybe make the site more secure (now is the perfect anti-exemple in all aspects and I want to make some time to at least shorten the list)
